# Linux kernel Git trees

This repository contains automated and non-automated Linux kernel Git trees.
The master branch is therefore disconnected from such kernel trees, solely to
provide this README doc.

## CentOS

For each CentOS source release, a git commit and a tag is automatically created
in the respective branch. This allows browsing and diff'ing the kernel source
changes between various CentOS kernel versions.

See the following tree branches:

* [CentOS 6.x](https://github.com/kernelim/linux/tree/centos6)
* [CentOS 7.x](https://github.com/kernelim/linux/tree/centos7)
* [CentOS 8.x](https://github.com/kernelim/linux/tree/centos8)
